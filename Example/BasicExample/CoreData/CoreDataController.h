 APIncrementalStore will add ACLa to a Parse Object when it finds a managed object that is being synced and
 contains a binary (NSData) property called '__ACL'. The property must be set as Binary and his content should be a JSON object
 UTF-8 encoded Parse ACL. Follow the same Parse ACL structure found on its REST API:
 
 {
    "8TOXdXf3tz": { "write": true },
    "role:Members": { "read": true },
    "role:Moderators": {"write": true }
 }
 
 Use PFObject objectID to identify specific users or role:<Role Name> for roles.
 This helper method show how to create and included it to a managed object.
 
 The Parse iOS-SDK doesn't allow us to inspect any existing ACL unless you know the user/role and you ask
 for the existing previlegies on that object. Based on that APIncrementalStore will only add ACLs to object, but it will not
 change any existent one.
